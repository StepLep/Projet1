As you can see, I’ve already created a basic Next.js application. In the “projet3/app/page.tsx” file, I want you to create the following elements for me:

a main screen with three attractive buttons:

	- cash receipts” button 
	- Disbursements” button
	- Cash flow plan” button


The “Inpayments” button takes you to a page where you can enter a date, a customer name and an amount before tax. 

The “Disbursements” button takes you to a page where you can enter a date, a supplier name and an amount.

The “Cash flow plan” button takes you to a page where you can enter a start and end date. Once the start and end dates have been entered, a calendar from the start date to the end date is displayed.

First, I just need you to create the pages
